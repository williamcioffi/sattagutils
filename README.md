[tutorial](https://williamcioffi.github.io/sattagutils) on some basic features.

## notes
### need to bring over
- plot\_dives2
- ~~censor\_tag2~~
- find\_gaps2
- plot\_status
- plot\_corrupt
### other to dos?

- should load\_tag be able to read the wch and figure out the settings? 
	- sampling period for series
	- min depth and duration for behavior dive qual
 
	(the wch file is mostly in hex so would have to figure this out)
	- should also look for htm if wch isn't available?
